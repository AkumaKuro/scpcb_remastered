# SCP - Containment Breach Remastered

This project is based on the original [SCP - Containment Breach](https://github.com/Regalis11/scpcb) project made by Regalis11

At the current stage, BlitzBasic code is being translated to TypeScript for debugging and easier modification than with the tools provided by the Blitz3D engine, to make it portable to more modern engines.

The game is based on the works of the SCP Foundation community (http://www.scp-wiki.net/).

Requirements:
â€¢	None. The project cannot be executed at the current time

Beware - the source code is perhaps more horrifying than the game itself! (For now)
